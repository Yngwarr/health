# TODO

# Essential

* Tests.
* Validation.
* Extract configs from the code.
* CI.

# Bonus points

* Removal confirmation dialog.
* Table pagination.
* Kubernetification.

# Nice to have

* Bulk deletion.
* Find a better way to assign ids to patients (to fill in the gaps, mostly).
* Improve search:
    - male should not match female;
    - match numbers only from start (e.g. 04 should not match 28042, same for
        dates);
    - search on enter.
